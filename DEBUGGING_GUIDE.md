## Overview

The Genetic Load Manager integration has been enhanced with comprehensive logging and debugging capabilities to help identify and resolve optimization issues. The system now provides:

- **Detailed logging** at every step of the optimization process
- **Debug services** for troubleshooting
- **Data validation** and quality checks
- **Error tracking** with full context
- **Comprehensive reports** for analysis

## Enhanced Logging

### Log Levels

The integration uses different log levels to provide appropriate detail:

- **DEBUG**: Detailed information for debugging
- **INFO**: General information about operations
- **WARNING**: Potential issues that don't stop operation
- **ERROR**: Issues that prevent normal operation
- **CRITICAL**: Severe issues that require immediate attention

### Log Files

Logs are automatically saved to:
- `~/.homeassistant/logs/genetic_load_manager/` - Main log files
- `~/.homeassistant/logs/genetic_load_manager/debug/` - Debug reports

### Key Logging Areas

#### 1. Forecast Data Fetching
```
=== Starting forecast data fetch ===
Fetching PV forecast data from entities:
  Today: sensor.solcast_pv_forecast_today
  Tomorrow: sensor.solcast_pv_forecast_tomorrow
Successfully fetched PV today entity: sensor.solcast_pv_forecast_today
```

#### 2. Data Validation
```
Data validation passed successfully
PV forecast: 96 slots, max: 3.245 kW
Load forecast: 96 slots, max: 2.100 kW
Battery SOC: 75.0%
Pricing: 96 slots, range: 0.0500-0.1200 â‚¬/kWh
```

#### 3. Optimization Process
```
=== Starting genetic algorithm optimization ===
Population initialized: 100 individuals, 2 devices, 96 time slots
Generation 0: Best fitness = -45.2341
Generation 50: Best fitness = -23.4567
```

## Debug Services

The integration provides several debug services that can be called from Home Assistant:

### 1. debug_optimization

Comprehensive step-by-step debugging of the optimization process.

**Service Call:**
```yaml
service: genetic_load_manager.debug_optimization
```

**What it does:**
- Checks genetic algorithm state
- Validates configuration
- Checks entity availability
- Tests data fetching

- Tests optimization readiness

**Output:**
```
=== Starting optimization debug ===
Step 1: Checking genetic algorithm state...
Step 2: Validating configuration...
Step 3: Checking entity availability...
Step 4: Testing data fetching...
Step 5: Validating data quality...
Step 6: Testing optimization...
=== Optimization debug completed ===
```

### 2. generate_debug_report

Generates a comprehensive debug report and saves it to a file.

**Service Call:**
```yaml
service: genetic_load_manager.generate_debug_report
```

**Report Contents:**
- System information
- Integration configuration
- Entity status
- Data summary
- Recent errors
- Debug data

### 3. validate_entities

Validates the status of all configured entities.

**Service Call:**
```yaml
service: genetic_load_manager.validate_entities
data:
  entities:
    - sensor.solcast_pv_forecast_today
    - sensor.load_forecast
```

### 4. test_data_fetch

Tests data fetching for all configured entities.

**Service Call:**
```yaml
service: genetic_load_manager.test_data_fetch
```

### 5. reset_optimizer

Resets the genetic algorithm optimizer to a clean state.

**Service Call:**
```yaml
service: genetic_load_manager.reset_optimizer
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Entity Not Found Errors

**Symptoms:**
```
ERROR: PV forecast entity not found: sensor.solcast_pv_forecast_today
ERROR: This entity may not exist or may be misconfigured
```

**Solutions:**
- Check entity ID spelling
- Verify entity exists in Home Assistant
- Check entity configuration in YAML
- Ensure entity is not disabled

### 2. Data Format Issues

**Symptoms:**
```
ERROR: No Solcast PV forecast data available from either entity
ERROR: This will result in zero PV generation forecast
```

**Solutions:**
- Check entity attributes for forecast data
- Verify data structure matches expected format
- Check entity state and attributes
- Use debug services to validate data

### 3. Optimization Failures

**Symptoms:**
```
ERROR: Data validation failed, cannot proceed with optimization
ERROR: Optimization returned no solution
```

**Solutions:**
- Run `debug_optimization` service
- Check data quality with `test_data_fetch`
- Validate entities with `validate_entities`
- Reset optimizer with `reset_optimizer`

### 4. Performance Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Slow optimization
- High CPU usage
- Memory issues

**Solutions:**
- Reduce population size
- Reduce number of generations
- Check data quality
- Monitor system resources

## Troubleshooting Steps

### Step 1: Check Basic Configuration

1. Verify integration is loaded:
   ```yaml
   # Check configuration.yaml
   genetic_load_manager:
     pv_forecast_today: sensor.solcast_pv_forecast_today
     pv_forecast_tomorrow: sensor.solcast_pv_forecast_tomorrow
     load_forecast: sensor.load_forecast
     battery_soc: sensor.battery_soc
   ```

2. Check entity availability:
   ```yaml
   service: genetic_load_manager.validate_entities
   ```

### Step 2: Test Data Fetching

1. Run data fetch test:
   ```yaml
   service: genetic_load_manager.test_data_fetch
   ```

2. Check log output for data quality issues

### Step 3: Debug Optimization

1. Run comprehensive debug:
   ```yaml
   service: genetic_load_manager.debug_optimization
   ```

2. Analyze output for specific issues

### Step 4: Generate Debug Report

1. Create comprehensive report:
   ```yaml
   service: genetic_load_manager.generate_debug_report
   ```

2. Review saved report file

### Step 5: Reset and Retry

1. Reset optimizer:
   ```yaml
   service: genetic_load_manager.reset_optimizer
   ```

2. Monitor logs for improvement

## Log Analysis

### Key Log Patterns

#### Successful Operation
```
INFO: === Starting forecast data fetch ===
INFO: Successfully fetched PV today entity
INFO: Data validation passed successfully
INFO: === Starting genetic algorithm optimization ===
INFO: Optimization completed successfully
```

#### Data Issues
```
ERROR: PV forecast entity not found
WARNING: Load forecast size mismatch: got 48, expected 96
ERROR: No Solcast PV forecast data available
```

#### Optimization Issues
```
ERROR: Data validation failed, cannot proceed with optimization
ERROR: Population initialization failed
ERROR: Fitness calculation returned invalid value
```

### Log Search Commands

Search for errors:
```bash
grep "ERROR" ~/.homeassistant/logs/genetic_load_manager/*.log
```

Search for specific issues:
```bash
grep "entity not found" ~/.homeassistant/logs/genetic_load_manager/*.log
grep "data validation failed" ~/.homeassistant/logs/genetic_load_manager/*.log
```

## Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Data Fetch Time**: How long it takes to fetch forecast data
2. **Optimization Time**: How long the genetic algorithm runs
3. **Memory Usage**: Memory consumption during optimization
4. **CPU Usage**: CPU utilization during optimization
5. **Error Frequency**: How often errors occur

### Performance Optimization

1. **Reduce Population Size**: Smaller populations run faster
2. **Reduce Generations**: Fewer generations complete faster
3. **Optimize Data Fetching**: Cache data when possible
4. **Monitor Resource Usage**: Watch for memory leaks

## Advanced Debugging

### Custom Logging

You can add custom logging to your configuration:

```yaml
logger:
  custom_components.genetic_load_manager: debug
  custom_components.genetic_load_manager.genetic_algorithm: debug
  custom_components.genetic_load_manager.pricing_calculator: debug
```

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode for more verbose logging:

```yaml
genetic_load_manager:
  debug_mode: true
  log_level: DEBUG
```

### Manual Testing

Test individual components manually:

```python
# Test entity access
state = hass.states.get("sensor.solcast_pv_forecast_today")
print(f"Entity state: {state.state}")
print(f"Attributes: {state.attributes}")

# Test data processing
from custom_components.genetic_load_manager.genetic_algorithm import GeneticLoadOptimizer
ga = GeneticLoadOptimizer(hass, config)
await ga.fetch_forecast_data()
```
