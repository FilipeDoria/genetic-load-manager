# EMS Algorithm Improvement Suggestions

## 1. Economic Intelligence & Price Forecasting
**Priority: HIGH** - Highest impact on cost savings

```python
def should_use_battery_economically(self, current_time, action_type):
    """Determine if battery action makes economic sense based on price forecasts"""
    look_ahead_hours = min(8, self.time_slots - current_time)
    if look_ahead_hours < 2:
        return False
    
    current_price = self.data['buy_prices'][current_time]
    future_prices = self.data['buy_prices'][current_time:current_time + look_ahead_hours]
    
    if action_type == 'charge':
        # Only charge if we expect to discharge at higher prices
        max_future_price = np.max(future_prices)
        return (max_future_price - current_price) > 0.05  # 5 cent threshold
    elif action_type == 'discharge':
        # Only discharge if current price is high relative to future
        min_future_price = np.min(future_prices)
        return (current_price - min_future_price) > 0.03  # 3 cent threshold
    
    return False
```

## 2. Battery Health & Degradation Modeling
**Priority: HIGH** - Protects battery investment

```python
def calculate_battery_degradation_penalty(self, soc_profile, charge_cycles):
    """Penalize actions that accelerate battery degradation"""
    degradation_penalty = 0
    
    # Deep discharge penalty (below 30% SOC)
    deep_discharge_hours = np.sum(soc_profile < 0.3)
    degradation_penalty += 50 * deep_discharge_hours
    
    # Rapid SOC change penalty (stress on battery)
    soc_changes = np.abs(np.diff(soc_profile))
    rapid_changes = np.sum(soc_changes > 0.15)  # >15% per hour
    degradation_penalty += 100 * rapid_changes
    
    # Cycle depth penalty (shallow cycles are better)
    cycle_depth = np.max(soc_profile) - np.min(soc_profile)
    if cycle_depth < 0.3:  # Very shallow cycles
        degradation_penalty += 200
    
    return degradation_penalty
```

## 3. Load Priority & Comfort Constraints
**Priority: MEDIUM** - Improves user experience

```python
def evaluate_load_comfort(self, schedules):
    """Evaluate how well the schedule meets comfort requirements"""
    comfort_penalty = 0
    
    for dev in self.devices:
        if dev['name'] == 'ac':
            # Penalize AC being off during hot hours
            hot_hours = [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]  # Peak heat hours
            for hour in hot_hours:
                if hour < self.time_slots and schedules[dev['name']][hour] == 0:
                    comfort_penalty += 150
        
        elif dev['name'] == 'ev_charger':
            # Ensure EV is charged by departure time
            departure = dev['departure_time']
            if departure < self.time_slots:
                total_charge = np.sum(schedules[dev['name']][:departure])
                required_energy = (dev['required_soc'] - dev['current_state']['soc']) * dev['battery_capacity']
                if total_charge < required_energy:
                    comfort_penalty += 1000 * (required_energy - total_charge)
    
    return comfort_penalty
```

## 4. Grid Stability & Power Quality
**Priority: MEDIUM** - Important for utility compliance

```python
def evaluate_grid_stability(self, imported, exported, total_load):
    """Penalize rapid power changes that could destabilize the grid"""
    stability_penalty = 0
    
    # Power ramp rate limits (kW/hour)
    max_ramp_rate = 3.0  # kW per hour
    
    for t in range(1, self.time_slots):
        # Import ramp rate
        import_ramp = abs(imported[t] - imported[t-1])
        if import_ramp > max_ramp_rate:
            stability_penalty += 100 * (import_ramp - max_ramp_rate)
        
        # Export ramp rate
        export_ramp = abs(exported[t] - exported[t-1])
        if export_ramp > max_ramp_rate:
            stability_penalty += 100 * (export_ramp - max_ramp_rate)
    
    return stability_penalty
```

## 5. Multi-Objective Optimization
**Priority: HIGH** - Ties everything together

```python
def multi_objective_fitness(self, individual):
    """Evaluate multiple objectives: cost, comfort, battery health, grid stability"""
    schedules = self.decode_chromosome(individual)
    total_cost, cost, penalty, soc, imported, exported = self.simulate_schedule(schedules)
    
    # Normalize objectives to similar scales
    normalized_cost = cost / 100  # Assuming typical daily cost ~100 EUR
    normalized_comfort = penalty / 1000  # Assuming max penalty ~1000
    normalized_health = self.calculate_battery_degradation_penalty(soc, 1) / 1000
    normalized_stability = self.evaluate_grid_stability(imported, exported, 
                                                       np.sum([schedules[dev['name']] for dev in self.devices], axis=0)) / 1000
    
    # Weighted sum (can be adjusted based on user preferences)
    weights = {'cost': 0.4, 'comfort': 0.3, 'health': 0.2, 'stability': 0.1}
    
    fitness = -(weights['cost'] * normalized_cost + 
                weights['comfort'] * normalized_comfort + 
                weights['health'] * normalized_health + 
                weights['stability'] * normalized_stability)
    
    return fitness
```

## 6. Adaptive Genetic Algorithm Parameters
**Priority: LOW** - Nice to have optimization

```python
def adaptive_ga_parameters(self, generation, best_fitness_history):
    """Dynamically adjust GA parameters based on convergence"""
    if generation > 10:
        # If fitness is improving slowly, increase mutation rate
        if len(best_fitness_history) > 5:
            recent_improvement = best_fitness_history[-1] - best_fitness_history[-5]
            if recent_improvement < 0.01:  # Small improvement
                return {'cx_prob': 0.6, 'mut_prob': 0.4}  # More exploration
            else:
                return {'cx_prob': 0.8, 'mut_prob': 0.1}  # More exploitation
    
    return {'cx_prob': 0.7, 'mut_prob': 0.2}  # Default values
```

## 7. Time-of-Use Tariff Optimization
**Priority: MEDIUM** - Depends on utility pricing structure

```python
def optimize_for_tou_tariffs(self, schedules):
    """Optimize for time-of-use electricity pricing"""
    tou_penalty = 0
    
    # Peak hours (higher prices)
    peak_hours = [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]
    # Off-peak hours (lower prices)
    off_peak_hours = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 21, 22, 23]
    
    for hour in peak_hours:
        if hour < self.time_slots:
            # Encourage battery discharge during peak hours
            if schedules['battery'][hour] > 0:  # Charging during peak
                tou_penalty += 200 * schedules['battery'][hour]
    
    for hour in off_peak_hours:
        if hour < self.time_slots:
            # Encourage battery charging during off-peak
            if schedules['battery'][hour] < 0:  # Discharging during off-peak
                tou_penalty += 150 * abs(schedules['battery'][hour])
    
    return tou_penalty
```

## 8. Weather-Aware Optimization
**Priority: LOW** - Requires external data integration

```python
def weather_aware_optimization(self, schedules):
    """Adjust optimization based on weather forecasts"""
    weather_penalty = 0
    
    # If cloudy weather is forecast, prioritize battery charging
    # If sunny weather is forecast, prioritize battery discharge
    # This would require weather data integration
    
    return weather_penalty
```

## Implementation Priority Order

1. **Economic Intelligence** (highest impact on cost savings)
2. **Battery Health Modeling** (protects your investment)
3. **Multi-Objective Optimization** (ties everything together)
4. **Load Priority & Comfort** (improves user experience)
5. **Grid Stability** (important for utility compliance)
6. **Time-of-Use Tariff Optimization** (depends on utility pricing)
7. **Adaptive Genetic Algorithm Parameters** (nice to have)
8. **Weather-Aware Optimization** (requires external data)

## Notes

- Each improvement can be implemented independently
- Test each improvement individually before combining
- Monitor performance impact of each change
- Consider user preferences when setting weights in multi-objective optimization
- Weather integration would require API access to weather services
